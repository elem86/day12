# Day 12

🎯 Day 12 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧠 Excel Mini-Game: Wordle Clone (Animal Edition)

Today I built a playable version of Wordle in Excel, using animal names as the secret words!

✅ What I built:

 - 🐾 A word picker button that selects a random animal name from a hidden list

 - 🎨 Conditional formatting logic for player feedback:

   - 🟩 Green for correct letter in the correct position

   - 🟨 Yellow for correct letter in the wrong position

   - 🟥 Red for incorrect letters

   - 🟢 Extra cells turn green when the word is shorter than the full guess row

  - ⌨️ Player guesses are entered manually in cells, with instant feedback on each attempt

🕒 As usual, I kept it under ~2 hours — and even though it’s built in Excel, it’s surprisingly fun to play!
